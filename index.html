    <h3>about software engineer</h3>
    <p>Software engineers create and maintain programs to address user needs. They typically work on teams to design, develop, test, and document applications. They also work with other stakeholders to determine user requirements and gather feedback for further improvements.

        Although you may hear the terms "software engineer" and "software developer" used interchangeably, the two roles have different emphases. Software engineers tend to focus on "big picture" design while developers tend to focus on programming work. In practice, however, software engineers often write original code.
        
        Aspiring software engineers should note several challenges associated with the role. Engineers must manage accelerating technological advancement and ever-changing user needs. Additionally, teams can face significant pressure to meet tight deadlines.</p>
